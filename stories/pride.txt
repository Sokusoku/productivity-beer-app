(Happy Long) "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." Elizabeth laughed, the sound bright and clear as a bell, her fine eyes meeting Mr. Darcy's across the crowded, candlelit ballroom of Netherfield. The stiff, cold pride that had once defined him and driven them apart had melted away completely, leaving only a warm, undeniable affection and vulnerability in his gaze. He bowed low, a gesture of humble devotion that shocked the onlookers, and in that moment, she knew with absolute certainty. The obstacles of class, family, and Lady Catherine's interference had vanished like morning mist.

=== VARIANT: sad | LENGTH: short ===
(Sad Short) The letter fell from Elizabeth's trembling hands. Lydia was lost, the family name ruined. Darcy turned away, his face a mask of cold indifference.

The love story ended before it began.

(Sad Long) The letter fell from Elizabeth's trembling hands, fluttering to the dusty floor of the inn like a dying bird. Lydia was lost, run off with the scoundrel Wickham, and the Bennet family name was irrevocably ruined in the eyes of society. Darcy turned away, his face a mask of cold, aristocratic indifference, the warmth she had started to see completely extinguished by the scandal. The gap between them was now an ocean, unbridgeable by apologies, money, or the deepest regret. She watched him leave the room without a backward glance, realizing with a breaking heart that her own stubborn prejudice and her family's unchecked folly had cost her the only man who had ever truly understood and challenged her. The love story she had just begun to hope for ended in silence and shame before it ever truly began, leaving her to a future of loneliness.

=== VARIANT: spicier | LENGTH: short ===
(Spicier Short) The rain soaked them both, plastering their clothes to their skin. Darcy didn't just propose; he demanded. "I love you," he breathed, stepping closer, invading her space. "Most ardently." His hand brushed her cheek, his thumb tracing her lip. The argument that followed wasn't about social standing; it was a clash of fiery tempers and suppressed desire that threatened to consume them both right there in the storm.
